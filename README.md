# CPU Scheduling Simulation

**Description:**  
This project simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Round-Robin (RR), and Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN). The project involves managing tasks across various states (ready, waiting, running) and addresses issues like task starvation. The simulation provides a controlled environment for observing the effects of different scheduling strategies on task management and CPU utilization.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will:

- Implement a simulation of CPU scheduling using four key algorithms: FCFS, SJF, RR, and HRRN.
- Manage a queue of tasks with varied execution times and priorities.
- Ensure that tasks transition between states (ready, waiting, running) based on the scheduling policy applied.
- Address potential issues such as starvation by incorporating logic to prevent long wait times.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gnozadi/cpu-scheduling-simulation.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd cpu-scheduling-simulation

# Compile the code
make
```

## Usage
After compiling, you can simulate the scheduling algorithms with specific task inputs.

```bash
# Run the scheduling simulation with test data
./scheduler_simulator input.txt
```

*Example input file format (`input.txt`):*
```
TaskName TaskType TaskDuration
T1 A 5
T2 B 3
T3 C 8
```

## Features
- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms**: Includes implementations of FCFS, SJF, RR, and HRRN.
- **State Transitions**: Manages task transitions through ready, waiting, and running states.
- **Starvation Mitigation**: Reduces the risk of task starvation in selected algorithms.
- **Randomized Testing**: Uses random input configurations to evaluate scheduling performance under various conditions.

## Project Structure
- **scheduler.c**: Contains the main scheduling logic and functions for state management.
- **input_parser.c**: Parses task inputs and initializes the task queue.
- **scheduler_simulator.c**: Runs the simulation based on the chosen scheduling algorithm.
- **Makefile**: Builds the project.

## Scheduling Algorithms
This project implements the following algorithms:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Tasks are processed in the order of arrival.
- **Shortest-Job-First (SJF)**: Tasks with the shortest duration are prioritized.
- **Round-Robin (RR)**: Tasks are given equal time slices in a cyclic order.
- **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**: Prioritizes tasks based on the response ratio to balance task waiting time and duration.
